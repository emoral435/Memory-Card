# Memory-Card Game (Pokemon Themed)

I made this as a fun project so that while I am bored waiting somewhere, I can play a little memory game using pokemon cards!

A website totally generated with React, TailwindCSS, Vite, Loadash, and deployed using GH Pages Script!

## Configuration

<p>using npm run dev will make it run as expected!</p>

### npm install

<p>run nmp install in the terminal to download the necessary dependencies for the project</p>

### npm run dev

<p>use npm run dev to build the production mode of the project</p>

## Usage

<p>Try to only click each pokemon once. If you do, your score starts back at one. Reaching 12 gets you a restart screen</p>
